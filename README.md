@Alligatorbruh \([Betastar](https://betastar.org/api/user?name=Alligatorbruh)\) is a huge skidder + nn and decided to skid 0hjay commands into his Betastar bot, so im releasing 0hjay publicly.   
maybe zastix shouldnt trust random people with his code? getting skidded from 101.

change "username" and "password" to the bot's username and password, run with a vpn as you should always do with xotic-powered websites.
