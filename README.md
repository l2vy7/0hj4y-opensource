@Alligatorbruh \([Betastar](https://betastar.org/api/user?name=Alligatorbruh)\) is a huge skidder + nn and decided to skid 0hjay commands into his Betastar bot, so im releasing 0hjay publicly.   
poor skid (afaik) does not know how to patch betastar.js so msg.send works ðŸ¤•   
maybe zastix shouldnt trust random people with his code? getting skidded from 101.

change "username" and "password" to the bot's username and password, run with a vpn as you should always do with xotic-powered websites.

alligatorbruh is most likely d13.
