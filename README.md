@Alligatorbruh \([Betastar](https://betastar.org/api/user?name=Alligatorbruh)\) (Preston C. Godfrey, 12 (or Jake C. Godfrey, 15???)) is a huge skidder + nn and decided to skid 0hjay commands into his Betastar bot DESPITE betastarbot (zastix's bot) already having them ported, so im releasing 0hjay publicly.   
poor skid (afaik) does not know how to patch betastar.js so msg.send works ðŸ¤• (you can easily use client.sendMessage instead psst psst)
maybe zastix shouldnt trust random people with his code? getting skidded from 101.

change "username" and "password" to the bot's username and password, run with a vpn as you should always do with xotic-powered websites.

alligatorbruh is most likely d13.

update from zastix:

he did get betastarbot mod however.
